Hello everyone,

We are thrilled to announce that the "NEXT" version of the What2REG@UM is now live and in the preview stage. In this latest update, we have implemented a completely new tech stack to enhance the overall user experience.

For the development of the entire application, we chose Next.js as our foundational framework. Leveraging this framework, we have adopted a fresh approach to static page construction and server-side rendering. We firmly believe that this will significantly improve our SEO optimization, making it easier for users to discover our pages on various search engines.

One of the key highlights of our update is the incorporation of innovative preloading techniques. In conjunction with Amazon's Lambda service, we have deployed the website across a global CDN servers, optimizing the user experience for individuals around the world.

A major revamp was done to the timetable simulator feature. We've implemented real-time updates across pages, allowing users to add a course to their shopping cart on one page while simultaneously updating the simulated timetable on another. This ensures a seamless and efficient user experience.

Additionally, we have rebuilt our user system using Clerk. This reconstruction lays the foundation for the development of more features, and we're actively working on expanding functionalities. If you're interested in contributing to the development of What2REG@UM, please visit our GitHub page.

In summary, the "NEXT" version marks a significant leap forward in terms of technology and user experience. We're excited about the possibilities it opens up and the enhanced features it brings to our users. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to your feedback as we strive to make What2REG@UM the go-to platform for course selection.
